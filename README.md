## v1.0.4
### Updated on 2022-02-13
## About
Feature expansion of DHCP assignments using AsusWRT-Merlin's [Addons API](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.ng/wiki/Addons-API) to read and write DHCP assignments, increasing the limit on the number of reservations.

YazDHCP is free to use under the [GNU General Public License version 3](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0) (GPL 3.0).

## Supported firmware versions
You must be running firmware Merlin 384.15/384.13_4 [Asuswrt-Merlin](https://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/)

## Installation
Using your preferred SSH client/terminal, copy and paste the following command, then press Enter:

```sh
/usr/sbin/curl -fsL --retry 3 "https://jackyaz.io/YazDHCP/master/install/YazDHCP.sh" -o "/jffs/scripts/YazDHCP" && chmod 0755 /jffs/scripts/YazDHCP && /jffs/scripts/YazDHCP install
```

## Usage
YazDHCP leverages the existing [LAN - DHCP Server](http://router.asus.com/Advanced_DHCP_Content.asp) page in the AsusWRT-Merlin WebUI. It has been modified under the hood to read and write to files in /jffs/addons/YazDHCP.d/ via the Addons API.

This allows us to use a greater amount of storage (6KB vs 2.5-3KB) for DHCP host assignments.

To launch the command line menu for YazDHCP after installation, use:
```sh
YazDHCP
```

If you do not have Entware installed, you will need to use the full path:
```sh
/jffs/scripts/YazDHCP
```

## Changes made to dnsmasq configuration
YazDHCP adds 3 lines to dnsmasq.conf.add to configure DHCP reservations:
```sh
addn-hosts=/jffs/addons/YazDHCP.d/.hostnames # YazDHCP_hostnames
dhcp-hostsfile=/jffs/addons/YazDHCP.d/.staticlist # YazDHCP_staticlist
dhcp-optsfile=/jffs/addons/YazDHCP.d/.optionslist # YazDHCP_optionslist
```
addn-hosts contains a list of IP address to hostname mappings, for DNS resolution of DHCP reserved clients
dhcp-hostsfile contains a list of MAC address to IP address bindings, to reserve a DHCP IP address for a MAC address
dhcp-optsfile contains a list of MAC address to DNS server address bindings, to provide the specified DNS server as a DHCP option for a MAC address

### Scarf Gateway
Installs and updates for this addon are redirected via the [Scarf Gateway](https://about.scarf.sh/scarf-gateway) by [Scarf](https://about.scarf.sh/about). This allows me to gather data on the number of new installations of my addons, how often users check for updates and more. This is purely for my use to actually see some usage data from my addons so that I can see the value provided by my continued work. It does not mean I am going to start charging to use my addons. My addons have been, are, and will always be completely free to use.
