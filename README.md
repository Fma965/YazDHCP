## v1.0.2
### Updated on 2021-02-27
## About
Feature expansion of DHCP assignments using AsusWRT-Merlin's [Addons API](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.ng/wiki/Addons-API) to read and write DHCP assignments, increasing the limit on the number of reservations.

YazDHCP is free to use under the [GNU General Public License version 3](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0) (GPL 3.0).

## Supported firmware versions
You must be running firmware Merlin 384.15/384.13_4 [Asuswrt-Merlin](https://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/)

## Installation
Using your preferred SSH client/terminal, copy and paste the following command, then press Enter:

```sh
/usr/sbin/curl --retry 3 "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fma965/YazDHCP/master/YazDHCP.sh" -o "/jffs/scripts/YazDHCP" && chmod 0755 /jffs/scripts/YazDHCP && /jffs/scripts/YazDHCP install
```

## Usage
YazDHCP leverages the existing [LAN - DHCP Server](http://router.asus.com/Advanced_DHCP_Content.asp) page in the AsusWRT-Merlin WebUI. It has been modified under the hood to read and write to files in /jffs/addons/YazDHCP.d/ via the Addons API.

This allows us to use a greater amount of storage (6KB vs 2.5-3KB) for DHCP host assignments.

To launch the command line menu for YazDHCP after installation, use:
```sh
YazDHCP
```

If you do not have Entware installed, you will need to use the full path:
```sh
/jffs/scripts/YazDHCP
```

## Changes made to dnsmasq configuration
YazDHCP adds 3 lines to dnsmasq.conf.add to configure DHCP reservations:
```sh
addn-hosts=/jffs/addons/YazDHCP.d/.hostnames # YazDHCP_hostnames
dhcp-hostsfile=/jffs/addons/YazDHCP.d/.staticlist # YazDHCP_staticlist
dhcp-optsfile=/jffs/addons/YazDHCP.d/.optionslist # YazDHCP_optionslist
```
addn-hosts contains a list of IP address to hostname mappings, for DNS resolution of DHCP reserved clients
dhcp-hostsfile contains a list of MAC address to IP address bindings, to reserve a DHCP IP address for a MAC address
dhcp-optsfile contains a list of MAC address to DNS server address bindings, to provide the specified DNS server as a DHCP option for a MAC address

## FAQs
### I haven't used scripts before on AsusWRT-Merlin
If this is the first time you are using scripts, don't panic! In your router's WebUI, go to the Administration area of the left menu, and then the System tab. Set Enable JFFS custom scripts and configs to Yes.

Further reading about scripts is available here: [AsusWRT-Merlin User-scripts](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/wiki/User-scripts)
